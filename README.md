## ü§ñ AI Integration Details

### OpenRouter Integration  
**AnyIdea?** uses OpenRouter to access free AI models for generating intelligent, personalized activity suggestions. This allows the app to:

- **Understand Context**: AI analyzes user preferences, mood, weather, and location to suggest relevant activities
- **Creative Suggestions**: Generate unique ideas beyond pre-defined categories  
- **Personalized Instructions**: Provide step-by-step guidance tailored to user skill level
- **Dynamic Responses**: Adapt suggestions based on real-time conditions

### AI Model Selection
- **Primary**: moonshotai/kimi-k2:free (currently implemented and working)
- **Fallback**: Basic rule-based recommendations if AI is unavailable
- **Cost**: Utilize free tier to keep the project budget-friendly

### AI Prompt Strategy
The AI receives structured prompts including:
- User preferences and constraints
- Current weather and location data
- Available nearby businesses/venues
- Time and budget limitations

Example AI prompt:
```
"A person in San Francisco with $20, 2 hours free time, wants outdoor activities, 
beginner fitness level, partly cloudy 68¬∞F weather. Suggest 3 specific activities 
with exact locations, costs, and step-by-step instructions."
```

### API Testing Examples

With the backend running on `http://localhost:8000`, you can test these working endpoints:

#### Get AI-Generated Suggestions
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/suggest" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "location": "San Francisco, CA",
    "activity_type": "creative",
    "mood": "relaxed",
    "energy_level": "medium",
    "budget": 25,
    "duration": 90
  }'
```

#### Create Custom Activity Category
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/activities/custom?session_id=your_user_id" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "category_name": "Mindfulness",
    "description": "Meditation and mindfulness activities"
  }'
```

#### Get User's Custom Categories
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/activities/custom?session_id=your_user_id"
```

#### Check Database Health
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/database/health"
```

#### Check API Health
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/health"
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "title": "Neighborhood Photo Walk & Coffee",
      "description": "A creative photography expedition through your neighborhood...",
      "duration": 90,

    }
  ],
  "weather_context": "Current weather: Mist, 57¬∞F",
  "personalization_notes": "Suggestions tailored for medium energy creative activities..."
}
```
